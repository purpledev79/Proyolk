# AKVideoImageView
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/AKVideoImageView.svg)

This class was created because I wasn't satisfied with standard Apple AVPlayer during creating a video background for one of my apps. AVPlayer doesn't let the phone to go to sleep mode. Also, you can't insensibly start a video from the first frame when app enters background. This class solves these problems, and in the end, you have a perfect solution for making gorgeous video backgrounds for your apps.

##Features

- Ability to dynamically switch videos
- Auto set the first frame of video to have seamless transition when app returns from background
- Minimal memory footprint
- Good performance
- Ability to use mp4 files as video source


##Installation

####Manually
Just add AKVideoImageView.h and AKVideoImageView.m files to your project.

####CocoaPods
Add the following line to your Podfile.

```
pod "AKVideoImageView", "~> 1.0"
```

Then run `pod install`.

##Usage

###Compressing your video file
Before starting using this class, you need to properly compress video.<br /> Here is an example of libx264 compression options on OS X system using ffmpeg utility:
<br />ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -level 3.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 1 -preset placebo -crf 19 -tune film -x264opts colorprim=bt709:transfer=bt709:colormatrix=bt709:fullrange=off output.mp4

###Basic Setup

In your view controller:<br />
```objective-c
#import "AKVideoImageView.h"

NSURL *videoURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"videoName" withExtension:@"mp4"];
AKVideoImageView *videoBG = [[AKVideoImageView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds
                                                           videoURL:videoURL];
[self.view addSubview:videoBG];
[self.view sendSubviewToBack:videoBG];
```

###Dynamically changing video

```objective-c
NSURL *videoURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"anotherVideoName" withExtension:@"mp4"];
self.videoBG.videoURL = videoURL;
```
